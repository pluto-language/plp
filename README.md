# plp

[Pl]()uto [P]()ackage Manager.

Doesn't really do much at the moment (since there's no source), but
in the future, you will be able to install, remove, and update,
Pluto packages.

```
plp +package    # installs a package
plp -package    # removes a package
plp ^package    # updates a package
```

Packages can be registered in the repository `pluto-language/packages` -
just submit a PR.
